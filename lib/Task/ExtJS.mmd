DESCRIPTION
===========

`Task.ExtJS` is JSAN distribution, containing ExtJS framework.


INSTALLATION
============

`Task.ExtJS` is distributing via JSAN - [JavaScript Archive Network][jsan]. To install `Task.ExtJS` you'll need to install JSAN shell first - a small unix-shell-like program.
It communicate directly with closest JSAN mirror and can download and install any JSAN module for you.

JSAN shell is written in perl, so the 1st step is to obtain Perl.


1. OBTAINING PERL
=================

Linux
-----

If you are on any relatively modern Linux distribution, you may skip this step, since you already have perl and all required perl modules. 


Windows
-------

Windows users should install [Strawberry perl][straberry]. Straberry perl is preferred against ActiveState perl, because it comes with the compiler included.

*NOTE:* After installation, you may need to relogin (or reboot) to see the updates in the PATH environment variable.


2. INSTALLING SHELL
===================

Installing shell
----------------

Launch a console (`cmd` on Windows). Then type:

       > cpan JSAN::Shell
    
Thats all, now wait until shell will be installed. You may be asked about installing its pre-requisites - answer 'yes'. 


3. INSTALLING `Task.ExtJS`
==========================

Launch a console (`cmd` on Windows). Then type:
    
        > jsan
    
This should launch a JSAN shell and display a prompt, similar to this:
    
        Checking for Internet access...
        Locating closest JSAN mirror...
        
        jsan shell -- JSAN repository explorer and package installer (v2.0006)
                   -- Copyright 2005 - 2009 Adam Kennedy.
                   -- Type 'help' for a summary of available commands.
        
        jsan>
    
In the shell, type:
        
        jsan> set prefix /your/installation/path/

        jsan> install Task.ExtJS

Thats all, shell will download and install `Task.ExtJS` for you. Try `help` command or refer to [JSAN::Shell documentation](http://search.cpan.org/dist/JSAN-Shell/lib/JSAN/Shell.pm) for details on using shell. 


4. CONFIGURING YOUR SYSTEM
==========================

After successfull completition of the procedure above, `Task.ExtJS` will be installed in the local JavaScript library.

The path to the library will be:

- /usr/local/lib/jsan

on Linux systems

- c:\JSAN

on Windows systems.

As a convention, its recommended to configure you local web server (you have one installed, right? ;) that way, that the root starting url `/jsan`
will point at the `lib` subdirectory of JSAN library: `/usr/local/lib/jsan/lib` for example.

This way you can load any installed JSAN module via url like: `/jsan/Useful/Module/Name.js`
